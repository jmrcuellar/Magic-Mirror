# MMM-Reddit

This module is used to show top level reddit info for Magic Mirror<sup>2</sup>.

It is highly configurable and primarily allows users to choose between two display types, the number of posts pull from reddit, how many of those posts to display, how often to cycle through the set of posts, and how frequently to refresh posts from reddit.

## NOTE

Currently working on a large refactor that will allow multiple instances of the module to run simultaneously. Please submit feature requests as issues tagged as an enchancement and please list the title as "v2: [your suggestion]".

Project ETA completion: holiday 2020

Titles that are truncated will have "..." appended to the title to indicate it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `titleReplacements`    | `[]`        | An array of objects used to make replacements to words or phrases in a title. Title replacements will occur prior to the character limit being enforced, so these can be used to help shorten post titles or just for fun.<br><br>**Example:** `[{toReplace: 'millennials', replacement: 'snake people', caseSensitive: false'}, {toReplace: 'politicians', replacement: 'lizard people'}]`<br><br>**Note:** `caseSensitive` defaults to true. Also accepts regular expressions for advanced find and replace, but do not include preceding and trailing forward slashes. For those not familiar with regular expressions, see [here](https://regexr.com/).                                                                                                                                                                |
| `forceImmediateUpdate` | `true`      | When set to `true`, as soon as posts are received from reddit according to the updateInterval, posts are immediately rendered, regardless of what is currently on screen. When set to `false`, the module will allow the existing set to finish and the new \#1 post will be from the updated set of posts.<br><br><b>Note:</b> If this is set to `false`, it's a good idea to try to keep the show &amp; count, rotateInterval, and updateInterval in good sync with this. For example, if you're using images, displaying 1 image with a count of 10 posts rotating every 30 seconds, it will take 5 minutes to cycle through a set. Therefore, ideally you'll want to set your updateInterval to a mutiple of 5 so that it's not waiting too long to update the posts as your update will appear somewhat inconsistent. |

## Dev Dependencies

If you plan on modifying the existing code, these tools will be helpful as the the css was created using sass. Once you have npm installed, simply run `npm install` for the subsequent npm packages to be installed.

- node-sass
- nodemon

**Note**: To make use of the installed packages run `npm run build-css` to compile scss to css and running `npm run watch-css` will watch the scss file for changes and compile on save.

## To Do

There is no timeline or guarantee than any of these will be accomplished. Will throughly review and test pull requests if anyone else wants to take any of these on.

- Write tests
- Allow widths other than pixels
- Add `gif` option as display type
  - Not sure if there's going to be a way to do this to ensure that the rotate doesn't fire before the gif is finished playing
- Add feature to display portion of text posts for subs such as r/dadjokes
- Add ability to allow user defined post ids for curated slideshow
- Add ability to query a subreddit(s) for a given phrase and return top hits
